      <h1> THROW IT AWAY </h1>
      <p><strong>What if I told you that every day, we throw away enough food to fill a football stadium?</strong> Yes, you read that right. In the United States alone, we waste an astonishing <strong>150,000 tons of food daily</strong>. That's equivalent to about 4.2 million tons a month or a staggering 50,400,000 tons of food per year.</p>

    <p><strong>Imagine a mountain of food, as high as a skyscraper. That's how much food we waste every single day.</strong> This is not just a number. It's a reflection of the overconsumption and wasteful habits that have become all too common in our society.</p>

    <p><strong>Every day, each of us throws away nearly a pound of food.</strong> That's a lot of food going to waste. And that's considering the United States alone.</p>

    <p><strong>This website aims to raise awareness about the issue of food waste and inspire action towards more sustainable practices.</strong> We'll delve into the damaging facts of food waste and loss, from its impact on our environment to its contribution to global hunger.</p>

    <p><strong>Stay tuned for eye-opening facts, easy tips to reduce your own food waste, and inspiring stories of change from around the world.</strong> Together, we can make a difference. Let's start today.</p>

  <div class="Trivia">
    <h2> Damaging facts</h2>
    <p>
    Did you know that every day in the United States alone, a staggering 150,000 tons of food goes to waste? That's equivalent to about 4.2 million tons a month, or a whopping 50,400,000 tons of food per year. It's a staggering amount of food that could be feeding millions of people.
</p>

<p>
    And that's just scratching the surface. Globally, the scale of food waste is even more alarming. Imagine this: around one third of all food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted, resulting in a financial loss of about US$1 trillion annually. It's a shocking reality that highlights the inefficiencies in our food systems.
</p>

<p>
    But here's what's truly heartbreaking: while food waste reaches astronomical levels, 811 million people still go to bed hungry every night. That's nearly one in ten people worldwide who don't have enough to eat. And it's not just about hungerâ€”it's about the missed opportunities to alleviate poverty and promote sustainability.
</p>

<p>
    Consider this: twenty-eight percent of the world's arable land is used to produce food that ultimately goes to waste, instead of nourishing those who need it most. And the water wasted in producing this food could fill Lake Geneva three times over. Just imagine if that precious resource was redirected into efficient agriculture to feed the hungry.
</p>

<p>
    But it doesn't end there. The environmental impact of food waste is equally concerning. When food ends up in landfills, it produces greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. In fact, food loss and waste account for over 3 billion tons of these gases per year. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
